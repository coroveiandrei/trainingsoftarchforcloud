# Problem description

Imagine a company of theatrical players who perform plays at various events. Typically, a customer will request a few plays and the company charges them based on the size of the audience and the kind of play they perform. There are currently two kinds of plays that the company performs: tragedies and comedies. As well as providing a bill for the performance, the company gives its customers “volume credits” which they can use for discounts on future performances—think of it as a customer loyalty mechanism.
The performers store data about their plays in a simple JSON file that looks something like this:

```
{
   "hamlet": {"name": "Hamlet", "type": "tragedy"},
  "as-like": {"name": "As You Like It", "type": "comedy"},
  "othello": {"name": "Othello", "type": "tragedy"}
}
```

The data for their bills also comes in a JSON file:

```
[
  {
    "customer": "BigCo",
    "performances": [
      {
        "playID": "hamlet",
        "audience": 55
      },
      {
        "playID": "as-like",
        "audience": 35
      },
      {
        "playID": "othello",
        "audience": 40
      }
    ]
  }
]
```


The code that prints the bill is this simple function:


```
function statement (invoice, plays) {
  let totalAmount = 0;
  let volumeCredits = 0;
  let result = `Statement for ${invoice.customer}\n`;
  const format = new Intl.NumberFormat("en-US",
                        { style: "currency", currency: "USD",
                          minimumFractionDigits: 2 }).format;
  for (let perf of invoice.performances) {
    const play = plays[perf.playID];
    let thisAmount = 0;

    switch (play.type) {
    case "tragedy":
      thisAmount = 40000;
      if (perf.audience > 30) {
        thisAmount += 1000 * (perf.audience - 30);
      }
      break;
    case "comedy":
      thisAmount = 30000;
      if (perf.audience > 20) {
        thisAmount += 10000 + 500 * (perf.audience - 20);
      }
      thisAmount += 300 * perf.audience;
      break;
    default:
        throw new Error(`unknown type: ${play.type}`);
    }

    // add volume credits
    volumeCredits += Math.max(perf.audience - 30, 0);
    // add extra credit for every ten comedy attendees
    if ("comedy" === play.type) volumeCredits += Math.floor(perf.audience / 5);

    // print line for this order
    result += `  ${play.name}: ${format(thisAmount/100)} (${perf.audience} seats)\n`;
    totalAmount += thisAmount;
  }
  result += `Amount owed is ${format(totalAmount/100)}\n`;
  result += `You earned ${volumeCredits} credits\n`;
  return result;
}
```

The outcome is:

```
Statement for BigCo
  Hamlet: $650.00 (55 seats)
  As You Like It: $580.00 (35 seats)
  Othello: $500.00 (40 seats)
Amount owed is $1,730.00
You earned 47 credits
```
